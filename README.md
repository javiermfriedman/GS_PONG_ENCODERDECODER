# GS_PONG_ENCODERDECODER

I am trying to first build an autoencoer that will rebuild the images properly

then I will export the latent vector for that 

which I will later use to use to cluster

model 1 does not reconstruct well at all 

use this repo as inspo
https://github.com/patrickloeber/pytorch-examples/blob/master/Autoencoder.ipynb

it is working now I lowered the amount of input data to prevent underfittings

and I also used a different architecutre
